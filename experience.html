          <h2>Experience</h2>
          <p>Curently, I am UX Researcher at an e-commerce company. I work with UX designers, product managers, and developer to create intuitive and valuable features. I work with data on a daily basis that are qualitative or quantitative in nature.</p>
          <p>Prior to my current role, I was a usability professional at a multi-channel retailer headquartered in Los Angeles. It was my first job after graduating with a Masters in Industrial Engineering. </p>

          <h2>Education and Skills</h2>
          <p>I have a Masters in Industrial Engineering and a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. Here's is a list of methods from my research tool box:</p>
          <ul class="skills">
            <li>Surveys Research</li>
            <li>Data Analysis</li>
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>Usability</li>
            <li>Interviews</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Iâ€™d like to learn front-end engineering and add more skills to the list above.</p>
        </section> 
        <div class="card2">
            <h2>Future Skills</h2>
            <p>Hopefully, by the end of this Tech Degree, I'd like to pick up skills that not only demystifies aspects of web site building but also give me the ability to create tools to automate redundant tasks.</p>
            <p>I am looking forward to interacting with the Treehouse commnunity via Slack. I cannot wait to dive in!</p>
