          <h2>Movies</h2>
          <p>I love watching movies! In the age of streaming, nothing excites me more than walking to a movie theater. Theaters are not dead!</p>

          <p>I'd love to construct a mini-theater with Critereon Collection Blu-rays. The mini-theater will have movie posters on frames. One day, I'd love to write a script (no pun intended).</p>

          <h2>Technology</h2>
          <p>I enjoying reading books, blogs, and online articles about technology and its applications in our lives. Learning more about technology inspires me to build my side project. </p>

          <h2>Business/Investing</h2>
          <p>Learning about why businesses fail is as important as knowing why businesses succeed. One can learn a lot in both cases.</p>
          <img src="images/business.jpg" alt="Business" class="card3-image">
          <p>Business and Investments are intertwined. Before investing in a business, one should not only understand its business model but be able to read the balance sheet to evaluate their financial health. </p>
